CSS
Positions: static, relative, absolute, fixed
Static - default positioning and flow of elements, not affected by top, bottom,left, right properties
  things flow around each other, things take up space(no overlap)
Relative - relative to where it would be, you can decide where to move it using the top, left ,bottom, right
  properties, physically in the same place as static, visually different, overlaps
Absolute - doesn't take up physical space on the page, visually it looks like it's there, but
  it's overlappping other things on page, uses top, left, bottom right
Fixed - doesn't take up physical space, relative to the viewport, good for navbars
  for example, you can scoll but the navbar is always on the top of your screen
  the viewport is the portion of the screen that the user can view
Sticky - similar to position relative, but when you scroll past it, it will "stick"
  to the viewport, good for ads
Dropdowns - Hover effect on an element displays a "dropdown" list of elements
  elements are merely hidden until the hover effect changes display:none to display:block
  list of elements appears on top of the rest of the page due to position:absolute
